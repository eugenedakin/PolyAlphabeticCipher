# PolyAlphabeticCipher
PolyAlphabetic Cipher

A polyalphabetic cipher is a method that is much more complicated and difficult to break than a Ceaser Cipher. This is a more secure method of encrypting and decrypting information which is called the Polyalphabetic Cipher.

Compatible OS's: All
Xojo IDE: 2020 r2.1
Xojo API: API 2
Level: Beginner

Code for this example is in the following two methods: 1) PolyCipherEncode, and 2) PolyCipherDecode

Instructions:

Run the program in Xojo 2020 r2.1
Add a Cipher Key String in the top TextArea
Enter your text in the Upper-Left TextArea Control
Press Encrypt to use the PolyAlphabetic Cipher Algorithm and the encoded text will appear in the control in the Upper-Right TextArea Control
To decrypt the message, place the encoded message in the Lower-Left Control
Press the Decrypt button
The decrypted message will then appear in the Lower-Right Control
The Methods can be copied and pasted to use in your program. This is written in native Xojo code.

An article was written in xDev (xdevmag.com) Issue 19.5 (September/October 2021) that describes the Xojo code. This is a great introduction to beginning a journey using ciphers, or also known as encoding/decoding data.
